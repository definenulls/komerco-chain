## Disclaimer

As this project evolves, the Komerco Labs developer team will focus on the latest version of the Edge client and does not plan to support Edge 0.6 or lower. It is highly recommended that you upgrade to the newest version with the most up-to-date features and fixes. Users that want to stay on 0.6 or below, can continue to do so. The repo will continue to exist and users can fork it and do with it as they please, subject to applicable open-source license terms.
